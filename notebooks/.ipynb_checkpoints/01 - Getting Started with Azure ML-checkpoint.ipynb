    "\n",
    "Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) is a cloud-based service that enables data scientists, AI software engineers, and others to collaborate on machine learning projects and manage data science workloads at scale. This is the first in a series of hands-on exercises that are designed to introduce the core concepts and components on an Azure ML solution. These exercises assume an existing knowledge of Python and general machine learning concepts and frameworks. Each exercise is provided in its own notebook - it is assumed that you will complete the exercises in order.\n",

    "In a separate browser tab, sign into your Azure subscription and view your portal at https://portal.azure.com. As you proceed through the tasks below, you'll toggle between this notebook and the portal to visually confirm that the code you've run here has had the intended results in your Azure subscription.\n",
