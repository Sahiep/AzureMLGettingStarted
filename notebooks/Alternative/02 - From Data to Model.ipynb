This approach works well for many kinds of experiment that you might want to run in the Azure ML workspace, including extracting statistical insights from data or training models. However, Azure ML also supports the use of an *Estimator* object that is designed specifically for model training. There's a generic estimator, and some framework specific estimators for common machine learning frameworks like Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.\n",
